Nepal has been described as a very ancient land in various religious scriptures and Puranas. The mountain ranges and valleys here, which were formed about 130 million years ago, have been particularly attractive to animals that have come later. The remains of Ramapithecus hominids found in the Butwal region of western Nepal clearly indicate that human settlement in Nepal began more than 10 million years ago.
